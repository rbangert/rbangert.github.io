## Narrative Description

On June 13th, 2024 my longtime partner Samuel Schaefer (30) and I, Russell Bangert (37) were enjoying all that Tuolumne provides, climbing the Northwest Buttress of Tenaya Peak (5.5, 1400'). This was my first day in Tuolumne, and Sam's third time up the route.

As we finish the route, storms are building in the distance, and we quickly scurry over the summit then down the shorter and steeper decent option back down into the cloud of mosquitoes that plague the area this time of year.

We proceed across the ledge system at the top of the slabs, back down into the mosquitoes as lighting strikes pop off in the distance. As we get lower, each step through the grassy parts of the ledge kicks up clouds of mosquitoes. After cracking jokes about our decision to leave the Deet in the car, I find myself looking out across the final section of slab down into the trees. A premature sense of relief washes over me as I miscalculate the frictional coefficient of my new approach shoes on the rock. I picture myself waltzing across it, then starting to run from the mosquitos through the forest, and back to the car. 

Suddenly, my left foot skates ever so slightly. I stop cold and my relief turns to fear, as I look down to notice I had walked out onto the most polished section of quartz monzonite I'd ever seen. 

I react by turning in to go rock climbing, on terrain that was not steep enough to do so. I drop my knee, and start sliding... ever so slowly. I fall into a sitting position and begin desperately padding with my hands and feet. I keep sliding without gaining too much speed across the first 30 feet of slab. I have time to look at Sam, say "oh no!" before looking out to realize I can't see what I'm falling down, and think "Sam's watching me die" as I begin picking up speed while screaming "no!" over and over. 

Just before the pitch increases, I make a meaningless attempt to shuffle out right to catch a shallow cleft in the rock. After my hands bounce off I turn out, finally able to see what I'm in for. The pitch picks up to over 70 degrees and I accelerate down the last 40 feet of slab.  

I have no memory of the impact, and the slope at the bottom of the slab was thankfully steep enough to allow me to just continue tumbling another 25 feet or so down, enough for Sam to regain view to see me rag doll and bounce twice.

My memory seems to promptly return after I come to a stop, face down on top of several basket ball sized rocks sticking up out of the dirt. I move my fingers, and then my toes... I'm not paralyzed! I roll over on my side moaning, see Sam scrambling down to me, and notice that I'm soaking wet, covered in mud, and I can't breathe. 

I stand up in a daze as Sam cries out for me to stop moving. I rip my shirt off, look at my body for trauma, sit down, then roll onto my back panting, looking up at the cloudy sky. Immediately, a swarm of mosquitoes descends upon me. I pick up my left arm to look at the dozen or so already on it, and make a futile attempt to brush them off before giving up to just lay there, as the swarm returns. 

Once Sam gets down to me we discuss the situation. I tell Sam I think I just have some bulging disks and my ribs hurt. He points out how good of a position we are in for a short-haul, and asks if I want him to go get help. I think about waiting there with the mosquitoes for hours, then go over the feedback my body is giving me from my injuries with him. I decide that I am going to try to walk the 100 feet to tree line to evaluate if walking out is on the table. 

I hobble into the trees, yell back to Sam that I'm good for it, and that I'm going to keep going. I tell him my phone flew out of my pocket, and my watch off my wrist and ask him to look for them before grabbing my bag and coming down to catch up to me.

After grabbing my things, he quickly catches up to me, and we finish the remaining 680 feet decent over 1.12 miles back to the car. I spend the next hour and a half shifting around in the passenger seat trying to minimize the pain until we get to the medical clinic in the valley. They load me up in an ambulance for a ride to El Cap meadow, where a CHP chopper is waiting to give me a ride to the nearest trauma center in Fresno. As we start rolling away, I loose it emotionally as I catastrophize about my future, and Dr. Warren (Who's now my PCP) clutches my hand back, while she pushes 50mg of ketamine into my IV.

## Analysis
As I finally finish writing this 9 months to the day after, I still routinely struggle with trying to comprehend the injuries I sustained, relative to the distance I traveled. The man who arrived in the trauma unit behind me was paralyzed from the waist down and needed an oral surgeon due to falling off his bike riding on the street in Fresno, with his helmet on. To my best estimates, I slid 70 feet down the slab, and then tumbled another 25 feet further down a fairly rocky slope, without a helmet. My only injuries were a mild compression fracture to my L1 vertebra, and a separated rib.

### My accident resulted from a combination of factors:
1. **Confirmation Bias** – 6 seasons in Little Cottonwood Canyon allowed me to feel right at home on my first day in Tuolumne. I thought I knew how polished a glacier could get some white granite. I'd walked outward down steeper slabs in flip flops!
2. **Complacency in Gear Selection** - I'm seasoned enough to have defaulted to carrying a small spray pen of Deet in the first-aid kit I *always* carry on me on alpine missions, from learning the mosquito lesson the hard way in the past. I was aware that I had forgotten it back in Huff, as I participated in the decision to leave Sam's bottle it in the car. 
3. **Complacency in the Final Stages** – With the end of the exposed scramble in sight, I let my guard down. We all know 80 percent of accidents happen on the way down. I've been cracking jokes about going in on the walk back to the car after doing something cool for a decade.  
4. **Moving with Haste** – The approaching storm and mosquito swarms created a false sense of urgency. Allowing external pressures to cause you to rush in consequential terrain is rarely a good idea. 

I am so extremely fortunate to have been able to get up and walk it off to avoid laying there for the mosquitoes on that damp slope. I don't have the resources required to fully communicate how grateful I am for the people here in Yosemite who have been there for me in some way, while I have been healing. The fact that I am not limited in anyway just 9 months later feels nothing short of miraculous.
